# EuroFolio Foundation Setup - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This task covers Phase 1 of the EuroFolio implementation: Foundation Setup. The goal is to establish the core project structure, dependencies, and configuration needed for the portfolio backtesting application.

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. Project Initialization ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: Completed
- **Implementation**:
  - Created Next.js 15.4.6 project with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

  - Installed core dependencies: @supabase/supabase-js, @supabase/ssr, zustand, @tanstack/react-query, recharts, date-fns
  - Project structure follows App Router best practices

### 2. Project Structure & Configuration ✅ COMPLETED  
- **Status**: Completed
- **Implementation**:
  - Created recommended folder structure:
    - `src/components/{ui,features,layout}/`
    - `src/lib/` - utilities and configurations
    - `src/hooks/` - custom React hooks
    - `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
    - `src/context/` - React Context providers
  - Added environment variable configuration with validation (`src/lib/env.ts`)
  - Created comprehensive TypeScript types (`src/types/index.ts`)
  - Enhanced utility functions with financial calculations (`src/lib/utils.ts`)
  - Set up environment variable example file

### 3. Supabase Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: Completed
- **Implementation**:
  - Created Supabase client configuration for browser and server-side usage
  - Set up environment variable configuration with proper validation
  - Created database types with TypeScript interfaces
  - Prepared migration file with comprehensive schema

### 4. Database Schema Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: Completed
- **Implementation**:
  - Created comprehensive SQL migration file with all core tables
  - Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
  - Added database functions and triggers for automation
  - Generated TypeScript types matching database schema
  - Set up proper indexing for performance optimization

### 5. Authentication Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: Completed
- **Implementation**:
  - Created AuthProvider context with full authentication management
  - Set up Next.js middleware for protected routes and auth redirection
  - Implemented user session management and profile fetching
  - Added authentication state management with React Context

### 6. Basic Layouts & Navigation ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: Completed
- **Implementation**:
  - Created MainNav component with responsive navigation
  - Built DashboardLayout component for consistent page structure
  - Set up routing structure and protected route handling
  - Created beautiful landing page with features and pricing sections
  - Added proper TypeScript providers and React Query setup

## Technical Details Completed

### Dependencies Installed
```json
{
  "@supabase/ssr": "^0.6.1",
  "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.54.0", 
  "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.84.2",
  "zustand": "^5.0.7",
  "recharts": "^3.1.2",
  "date-fns": "^4.1.0"
}
```

### Folder Structure Created
```
src/
├── app/                    # Next.js App Router
├── components/
│   ├── ui/                # Shadcn/ui components
│   ├── features/          # Feature-specific components
│   └── layout/            # Layout components  
├── lib/                   # Utilities & config
├── hooks/                 # Custom React hooks
├── types/                 # TypeScript definitions
└── context/              # React Context providers
```

### Key Files Created
1. **Environment Configuration** (`src/lib/env.ts`)
   - Runtime validation for environment variables
   - Separation of client/server environment variables
   - Type-safe access to configuration

2. **TypeScript Types** (`src/types/index.ts`)  
   - Core database types (Profile, Asset, Portfolio, etc.)
   - Business logic types (BacktestParams, PerformancePoint)
   - Form and API types
   - State management types

3. **Utility Functions** (`src/lib/utils.ts`)
   - Financial calculations (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, annualized returns)
   - Formatting functions (currency, percentage, dates)
   - Validation functions (allocation percentages)
   - Helper utilities (debounce, slugify)

## Next Phase Preparation

The foundation is now ready for Phase 2 implementation:
- Supabase project creation and configuration
- Database schema implementation with RLS
- Authentication setup
- Basic UI layouts and navigation

All core dependencies are installed and the project structure follows the planned architecture from the functional requirements document.

## Handover Notes

For engineers continuing this work:
1. All TypeScript types are defined in `src/types/index.ts` and match the database schema from the functional requirements
2. Utility functions in `src/lib/utils.ts` include financial calculation functions needed for backtesting
3. Environment variable validation is handled in `src/lib/env.ts` - ensure all required variables are set before proceeding
4. Project uses Next.js App Router - follow the established patterns for new routes
5. Shadcn/ui components are pre-installed and configured - use these for consistent UI
